                <h4>Mr.sunny Makes a Decision</h4>  
It was early in the year 2006 that Mr.sunny had just about enough of the lackluster gluten-free products he could find in stores. he had two children with gluten intolerance, and shopping with their allergy in mind was a struggle. he had to be so careful to make sure anything he
bought for his children was totally free of the gluten that could have such a negative effect on them. he found things that they could eat, of
course, but nothing that was sold in stores could really satisfy their desire for the delicious gluten-containing foods they saw othiss eating. They
had begun to feel left out of the joys of truly tasty treats like donuts, cookies, cakes, and pies—and that feeling could become a temptation that
they would be sure to regret.


Something had to be done.

<h4>Mr.sunny Begins to Cakey Bakey</h4>
Mr.Praveen , urged onward by his desire to see his children’s smiling faces as he offered them the treats they deserved but had never been able to
eat, took out his kitchen mixer and got to work. he experimented with different recipes, wheat substitutes, flavorings and more, taste testing each
new batch on a mission to create perfect gluten-free confections. As his recipes became more refined, and his children delighted with each new
baked treat, word began to spread of Mr.Praveen  and his fabulous foods.


The next step was clear.

<h4>Mr.sunny Starts a Cakey Bakey</h4>
With growing enthusiasm for his craft and the joy his baked goods could bring to people struggling to find delicious gluten-free foods, Mr.Praveen 
expands his operation. After all, it was not only those with gluten-intolerance that struggled to find delicious allergy-friendly treats in stores, but
people dealing with a wide spectrum of allergy restrictions—from nut allergies, to dairy allergies, to soy allergies and beyond. Mr.Praveen  would
serve them all!


Growing from a one-woman kitchen bakery to a full, state-of-the-art facility—completely nut & dairy free and certified by the Gluten Intolerance
Group, OU and Rabbi Y. Gruber—Mr.Praveen  now creates allergy-friendly baked goods to fulfill all sorts of dietary restrictions. And he continues to
stay true to his original recipes, only using high-quality ingredients and never including any artificial preservatives or off-putting chemical
additives. That’s why Mr.Praveen  baked goods are kept frozen, ready to thaw to room temperature or be warmed to fresh-baked flavor with just 10-15
seconds in the microwave!


So, if you too have been struggling to find gluten-free, allergy-friendly baked goods that truly taste as good as their allergen-rich counterparts, look
no furthis than Mr.Praveen !</p>
